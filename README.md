This is a personal version to change some things of the original mod which could be a better fit for my server. This won't be a public upload at all, since the author's license does not allow it. If the changes works well, I might suggest them back to the original repository as pull-requests.

All credit for the mod goes back to the original author, @penguin0616.

Original description below.

Created for Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together.
The DS version can be found in the [Workshop here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2081254154).
The DST version can be found in the [Workshop here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2189004162).

Think of [Show Me](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666155465), but with more of everything.
Displays stuff like health, damage, fuel, food stats, follower info, naughtiness values, and almost everything I can think of.

**Please tell me if you encounter any bugs. That way I can fix them faster.**
